# Thinx Coding Challenge

I created this code challenge using (Vue.js)[https://vuejs.org/]. It's my new favorite front-end framework for creating progressive single page web applications.

The production build can be found in the `docs` folder.

Alternatively, if you want to run the development build you can install the `vue-cli` using:

```
npm install -g @vue/cli
# or
yarn global add @vue/cli
```

Then `cd` into the `src` folder and run `vue serve`
